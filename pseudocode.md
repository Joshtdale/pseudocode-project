## Equipment setup
- Espresso machine
    - Water temperature should be set between 199°F-205°F
    - Water pump pressure should be set at 9 bar (this is the equivalent to 130.53396396 Pounds per square inch)
- Grinder
    - Grind size should be set between 200-400 microns

## Extraction process 

1. Use grinder to **grind** 18 grams of coffee into the portafilter

2. Gently **tap** portafilter to evenly distribute the ground coffee

3. **Place** portafilter on or against the counter

4. **Place** tamper on top of ground coffee so that it is level relative to the portafilter

5. Use tamper to firmly **compress** ground coffee using **20 - 30lbs** of level downward force.

6. **Remove** tamper from portafilter

7. **Lift** portafilter up into the espresso machine so that the portafilter is properly seated in the group head of the espresso machine

8. **Turn** portafilter counter clockwise to lock into the espresso machine

9. **Place** scale under portafilter 

10. **Place** cup on top of scale

11. **Reset** scale so that it reads 0 grams

12. **Activate** the espresso machine water pump

13. **Deactivate** the espresso machine water pump when the output of espresso reads 36 grams on the scale

    - **If** 36 grams of espresso is yielded in a time frame between 23-35 seconds starting at pump activation and ending at pump deactivation then the process is complete

## Troubleshooting
    - **If** yield time is greater than 35 seconds then make grind setting on grinder slightly finer
    - **If** yield time is less than 23 seconds then make grind setting on grinder slightly coarser
    - **After** appropriate grind adjustment has been made, repeat steps 1-13 till adequate yield time is achieved or the espresso tastes good
